Problems:
I encountered a problem implementing polymorphism in C++ as I'm used to dynamically
typed languages(mainly ruby) the difference between set pointer value and object value
was not clear at first.

Solution:
After reading the documentation and reviewing the power points implementing polymorphism
in C++ became clear.

Thoughts:
I enjoyed this project and feel that the pair programming aspect of the project helped
several students.
