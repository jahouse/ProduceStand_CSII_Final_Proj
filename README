Note
We completed all extra credit and have an input file (called inputMulti.txt) for
the 2nd EC opportunity.

Program Problems
Problems encountered with the program centered primarily around implementing 
the polymorphism and an unnecessary additional output that was being generated.

Solved Problems
Implementing the polymorphism involved the use of a vector pointer and 2D vector
pointer both of type 'ProduceStand' in the loadData function (which returned the
2D vector pointer). The vector pointer stored individual sales (push_backed fruits
and vegetables) while the 2D vector pointer stored orders (push_backed sales). In
the driver, a nested for loop calls each sale and order as needed to print the right
output.
The issue with the additional output was resolved by using a different condition for
the while loop that went over the input file (checking for numItems rather than having
it read until EOF).

Sentiment
The project wasn't too bad after the initial hurdles were overcome. One of the more 
challenging due to the aforementioned problems, however.
